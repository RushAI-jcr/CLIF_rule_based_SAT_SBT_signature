# Output Directory

Pipeline outputs are organized into two subdirectories:

- **`intermediate/`** -- Per-site intermediate files (cohort, SAT/SBT datasets). These are inputs for downstream analysis scripts.
- **`final/`** -- Final results for the manuscript (figures, tables, pooled statistics).

## Naming Convention

Output files follow the CLIF convention:
```
[RESULT_NAME]_[SITE_NAME]_[TIMESTAMP].ext
```

## Contents

All files in this directory are gitignored and regenerated by the pipeline.
